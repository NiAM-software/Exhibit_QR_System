The first U.S. commercially licensed helicopter – the Bell Model 47.

A Bell Rocket Belt – Made famous from the James Bond™ movie, “Thunderball.”
A Bell Lunar Ascent Engine, a test version of the engine used to blast the astronauts off the surface of the moon returning them to their Apollo Spacecraft. The engine was designed and built in Western New York.
The actual control panel used by a mission controller during the Apollo moon missions.
A Curtiss JN-4 (Jenny) – the premier World War I trainer aircraft for all the country’s military services. Also, the “Jenny” is famous as “the barn storming aircraft” of its era. The Museum owns this and is restoring to static museum quality.
A Cunningham-Hall GA-36 a 1930’s era revolutionary short take off and landing aircraft.
Our Lunar Module Ascent Engine was critical to returning the Apollo astronauts safely from the Moon.

The Museum strives to maintain this evidence as a part of the collective consciousness of our area.
