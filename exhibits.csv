4,1908 June Bug,Display Board,,Main Room,near Ladies room,Wall,4232,,1908,"n the context of databases and the MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control) model, the terminology may be a bit more specific. In MVCC, the concepts of ""data blocks"" and ""physical blocks"" can have distinctions based on the way versions of data are managed for concurrent transactions. Let's clarify:

Data Blocks in MVCC:

In MVCC, a ""data block"" is often associated with a version of a record or a row in a database table.
Each version of a row is stored in a data block, and multiple versions of a row can coexist in the database over time, allowing for concurrent transactions.
Physical Blocks in MVCC:

""Physical blocks"" in the MVCC context typically refer to the actual blocks of data on the storage device (e.g., disk or memory) that store the versions of records.
These physical blocks may include various versions of data, each associated with a particular transaction timestamp or a system version number.
In summary, in MVCC, ""data blocks"" are often more closely tied to the logical versioning of records in the database, while ""physical blocks"" refer to the storage-level blocks that contain these versions. The MVCC model is designed to provide a consistent and isolated view of the data for each transaction, allowing for concurrency without sacrificing data integrity."
